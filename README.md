# Simple Calculator

## Project Overview

This is a simple calculator program written in Python. It allows the user to perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program is designed to be run from the command line, and it handles basic error checking, such as division by zero.

## Features

- **Addition:** Adds two numbers.
- **Subtraction:** Subtracts the second number from the first.
- **Multiplication:** Multiplies two numbers.
- **Division:** Divides the first number by the second. Includes error handling to prevent division by zero.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.x:** Ensure that Python is installed on your system. You can check your Python version by running:
  ```bash
  python --version

# Installation
Clone the Repository:
If you're using Git, you can clone the repository to your local machine. Open a terminal or command prompt and run:

git clone <your-repo-url>
Navigate to the Project Directory:
Change to the project directory where the calculator.py script is located: cd path/to/simple_calculator

# Running the Script
Open a Terminal or Command Prompt:

On Windows: Press Win + R, type cmd, and press Enter.
On macOS or Linux: Open your preferred terminal application.
Navigate to the Project Directory:
If you haven't already navigated to the directory, use the cd command:
cd path/to/simple_calculator

# Run the Script:
Use the following command to run the calculator script: 
python calculator.py

If you’re using Python 3 specifically, use: python3 calculator.py

# Interact with the Program:
The program will prompt you to select an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
After selecting the operation, you’ll be asked to input two numbers.
The program will then output the result of the operation.
Example Interaction:
Select operation:
1. Add
2. Subtract
3. Multiply
4. Divide
Enter choice (1/2/3/4): 1
Enter first number: 5
Enter second number: 3
5.0 + 3.0 = 8.0

# Error Handling:
Division by Zero: If the user attempts to divide by zero, the program will return an error message: "Error! Division by zero."
